// Window handling and drawing

requirements:
    general:
        efficiency ++
        scalability -
    features:
        draw windows +
        erase window + (redraw below)
        move windows + (and clean up)

    ideas:
        variable window shapes
        gpu acceleration ??
            shaders
        filters


implementation:
    class Screen => stores current screen data, and chunks

    Chunks => need to be rescalble on demand / grid needs to be rescalable

    Window {
        x,
        y,
        width,
        height,

        content

        overlays ? / border ?
    } => rescalable?

    Drawer only draws data to screen (exept cutting of strings that are outside the screen, and prevents overwriting uneccesarily ?) => draw queue ?
